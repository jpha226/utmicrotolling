   introduces a tax-based algorithm for incentivizing self-interested
   agents to distribute themselves across different paths on a graph.
   Assumes full knowledge of the agents' sources and destinations, and
   that they are all starting their trips at the same time (though that
   last assumption could be easily relaxed).  Main method is iterative
   forward simulation, increasing taxes along congested roads.  Relative
   small-scale simulations.
